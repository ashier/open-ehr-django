This is a simple packaging of Paul Irish's HTML5 Boilerplate into a base
Django template and sensibly laid-out media folder. Use it with rhec's HTML5
Django plugin for an excellent


WHAT'S IN IT?

Paul Irish's HTML5 Boilerplate is a great place to start for next-generation
web project, providing you're a fan of jQuery ;) It packages a whole heap of
useful tools - modernizr to add HTML5 elements to IE6/7/8, jQuery via Google
CDN (with a local fallback), etc. It also overrides console.log() to provide
much more useful behaviour.

For full details of what HTML5 Boilerplate gives you, see

This packaging of the boilerplate simply wraps it up into a good base Django
template for use in your django projects, with each chunk of the boilerplate
wrapped up into blocks for you to override/customise at your convenience.


HOW TO USE IT

The paths in the base.html template are configured to work with Django's
default MEDIA_ROOT setting; drop the contents of the 'media' folder into your
media root and everything should work. If you're using a different MEDIA_ROOT
than '/media/', then you'll need to update the pathing in the base.html
accordingly

Place the contents of 'templates' folder into a directory you've included in
your TEMPLATE_DIRS list, and rename the 'myapp' subfolder to the name of your
first app. Providing base.html is at the root of a TEMPLATE_DIRS directory,
you can simply {% extends 'base.html' %} in any of your templates to get all
of the HTML5 Boilerplate's included functionality.


USING WITH django-mediagenerator

Add django-mediagenerator to your virtualenv (or what ever alternative you use):
pip install django-mediagenerator

Place django-html5boilerplate somewhere that it can be found as an app, ie:
ln -s ../django-html5boilerplate html5boilerplate

Add html5boilerplate and mediagenerator to INSTALLED_APPS:
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'mediagenerator',
    'html5boilerplate',
    ...
)

Add mediagenerator middleware. mediagenerator must be the first item listed.
MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
    'mediagenerator.middleware.MediaMiddleware',
) + MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES


Import the HTML5_MEDIA_BUNDLES into settings.py, or copy the required sections
from media.py into settings.py, ie:

from html5boilerplate.media import HTML5_MEDIA_BUNDLES
MEDIA_BUNDLES += HTML5_MEDIA_BUNDLES

Override boilerplate.html to your taste using a base.html that extends
boilerplate.html. You can simple copy the existing base.html from
html5boilerplate into your templates folder.
Then just extend base.html for all your templates.


STATIC landing.html EXAMPLE

By modifying urls.py to include the following you can quickly test landing.html.

from django.views.generic.simple import direct_to_template

urlpatterns = patterns('',
    ...
    url(r'^$', direct_to_template, {'template': 'landing.html'}),
)


PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT

Make sure you run ''python manage.py generatemedia'' prior to deployment to
update all static file changes.
